# GAMEPLAY
########################

- GOAL
------------------------
The winner of the game is the last player to have units alive in the game.
If a player looses all his units/ressources, he is eliminated.

- BEGINNING
------------------------
Once in the game, you will recognise your "home" node as it is the same colour as your colour in the lobby.

- CONQUER
------------------------
You can then drag'n drop units from your node to others in order to conquer free or neutral nodes, or to figth your opponents.
The unit percentage sent on each drag'n drop can be changed during the game with the four lower left buttons (25%, 50%, 75% or 100%).
By default, the game starts with 50%.

- POWERS/MANA
------------------------
To use the four special power buttons on the left of the game scene, you must first increase your mana bar (on the very left of the screen).
To increase your mana, you have to "sacrifice" your units in a power/mana node (Big dark blue nodes). You can send your units to this node from any of your nodes.

Mana cost for using each power is as follow.

- TELEPORTATION :	40
- ARMOR 	:	10
- DESTROY 	:	80
- INVINCIBILITY :	50

The mana bar can be filled up to 200 manapoints maximum.
